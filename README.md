Down below you will find a modified version of the Polybar baked-in [Arcolinux-Hefftor-HLWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwWSqCDeWgk).<br /> 

**If you want to try it out and don't know how to install it...**Very soon, I show step-by-step how to install the polybar on your Xfce. <br />

------

***Warning:*** This Polybar just gives support to Xfce. I don't know if it will work on KDE. (You can try it, by your own risk!)
<br />

**The begining...** You may be thinking: Hm... Cool, but... why Xfce?<br />

This is the question, this is why! Let me think where to start from....<br />

I've never seen any Polybar been used on an Xfce, so far. Then, I thought: why not? Why not to bring this beaulty to Xfce?<br />
Because most of the time it's usual to see it with [Tiling Window Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj1IfdKY0CU), such as:<br /> 

<pre>Herbstluftwm (HLWM), Bspwm, Awesome, i3, XMonad... Just to name a few.</pre>

I just wanted something different! So, I came up with this idea, to try to adapt a Polybar to Xfce.<br />

That was very tiring, by the way... but after a long and hard work, I made it!<br />
Now, I will try to show you, what I've made, and how you can modify it, to help you to suit your needs!<br /> 
<br>

**Aditional information:**<br /> 

For a better experience, I do recomend you to try the "Vicyos-Hefftor-Polybar" together with [Arcolinux Hefftor Edition Xfce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRMeoQZFB3E).


**I don't know if you have ever listened to these songs... So, [check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hf6lgC3-Q&t) them [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1NSgR4svTg&t)...** <br />

**Let's start talking about the space between the "Polybar" and a "Window"!**<br /> 

Hey, boy... I told you, I wanted something different! Most of the time, when a user maximaze a window, it gets lined up with the "taskbar". I think, this small detail, gave the Polybar a better looking!
